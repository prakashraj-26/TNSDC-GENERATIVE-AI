**Skin Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Network**

**Overview:**

Skin Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Network is a deep learning project aimed at automating and enhancing the diagnostic process for dermatological conditions. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the project provides a robust system for accurately classifying skin disease images into various disease categories.

**Features:**

- Automated Classification: The system automates the classification of skin disease images, reducing manual inspection time and enabling faster treatment decisions.
- High Accuracy: The CNN-based model is trained on a diverse dataset of skin disease images, ensuring high accuracy in classification across different disease categories.
- User-Friendly Interface: The system includes a user-friendly interface for easy access by dermatologists, healthcare professionals, and patients.
- Scalability: The model can be updated and retrained with new data, ensuring scalability and adaptability to evolving healthcare needs.
- Improved Healthcare Delivery: By streamlining the diagnostic process and providing timely and accurate classifications, the project aims to enhance healthcare delivery, leading to better patient care and outcomes.
